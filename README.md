#Simon-Says-Clone

A small vanilla JavaScript clone of the popular Simon Says memory game.

Known Issues:
1. When the user correctly chooses the button that lit up, they don't receive a new round indication.
2. The next round does start, lighting up an additional button (although much to quickly, needs to happen sequentially).
3. Doesn't wait for the user to click more than one button before generating a new number, and flashing them.
